"""Base data model for service offerings.

This module defines `ServiceOfferingData`, a base model containing the core fields
for service offering data that is shared between:
- unitysvc-services (CLI): Used for file-based service definitions
- unitysvc (backend): Used for API payloads and database operations

The `OfferingV1` model extends this with file-specific fields like `schema_version`
and `time_created` for data file validation.

    Base data structure for service offering information.

    This model contains the core fields needed to describe a service offering,
    without file-specific validation fields. It serves as:

    1. The base class for `OfferingV1` in unitysvc-services (with additional
       schema_version and time_created fields for file validation)

    2. The data structure imported by unitysvc backend for:
       - API payload validation
       - Database comparison logic in find_and_compare_service_offering()
       - Publish operations from CLI

    Key characteristics:
    - status maps to database 'status' field
    - Contains all user-provided data without system-generated IDs
    - Does not include permission/audit fields (handled by backend CRUD layer)
    - Provider relationship is determined by file location (SDK mode) or
      by being published together in a single API call (API mode)
